# The Elements of Programming

1. Primitive Expressions, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with
2. Means of Combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
3. Means of Abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements:

1. Procedures, descriptions of the rules for manipulating data
2. Data, "stuff" that we want to manipulate
