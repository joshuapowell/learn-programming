## History of Lisp

Well-designed computational systems are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

The Lisp or LISt Processing language was created in the 1950's by John McCarthy and appeared in his 1960 paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine".

The first Lisp interpreter was implemented by McCarthy with the help of colleagues and students in the ARtificial Intelligence Group of the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics and in the MIT Computation Center.

## LISP Vocabulary
